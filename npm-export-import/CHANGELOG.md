# Changelog

All notable changes to the NPM Export Import add-on will be documented here.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-09

> 🚀 **NPM Export Import has leveled up — it now has its own home.**
>
> This is the **final release** of NPM Export Import in this repository. All future
> development — features, fixes, and updates — continues over at its dedicated repo.
> This entry won't be updated again, so go check it out.
>
> **Add the new source to your Home Assistant app store:**
> **[https://github.com/SlopSync-Labs/ha-app-npm-export-import](https://github.com/SlopSync-Labs/ha-app-npm-export-import)**
>
> The new repo comes with stable, beta, and dev variants. Install **NPM Export Import**
> from the new source, then uninstall this one when you're ready to cut over.
>
> The latest release includes the ability to export, download, and restore your full
> server configuration — so migration is genuinely painless.
>
> > ⚠️ **Heads up:** When uninstalling this app, do **NOT** enable **"Also remove app data"**
> > if you want to keep your existing export files. They live in `/share/npm-export-import/`
> > and will carry over just fine — just leave that option unchecked.

### Changed

- Repository migrated to dedicated home: SlopSync-Labs/ha-app-npm-export-import

---

## [0.2.12] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Server Config Backup** — export and import NPM server connections (URL, credentials)
  as a JSON file stored in `/share/npm-export-import/`
- Optional AES-256-GCM password encryption for server config exports; unencrypted
  exports display a plaintext warning
- Custom label field on export — appended to filename alongside date
  (e.g. `servers-config-export-home-lab-2026-06-09.json`)
- Merge or Replace import modes — merge skips servers whose name already exists;
  replace overwrites the full server list
- File upload — upload a previously downloaded server config file directly from
  your browser without needing filesystem access
- Download button in Server Config Backup Import — download selected backup files
- Delete button in Server Config Backup Import — delete unwanted backup files with
  arm/confirm pattern for safety

---

## [0.2.10] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Test Connection now supports 2FA-protected accounts using same authentication flow as
  export/import; shows OTP modal and auto-retries after verification

---

## [0.2.9] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- Test Connection button now works on existing servers without requiring password re-entry;
  uses stored credentials for authentication test

---

## [0.2.8] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Test Connection button** in Configuration tab — validates server credentials by attempting
  authentication and shows success/error status inline

---

## [0.2.7] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Download button — icon button next to Import/Delete allows downloading selected export files
  directly to the browser

### Changed

- Delete and Download buttons moved to the far right of the import actions row
- Operation status messages moved from shared top-of-page status bar to inline elements next to
  section headings
- Button styling updated with new icons

### Fixed

- Let's Encrypt certificate request payload corrected to send `meta: {}` format expected by NPM
- SSL certificate creation logic refined to properly handle existing certificates
- Certificate request handling improved for hosts that already have certificates assigned

---

## [0.2.6] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- Footer at the bottom of the page: "SlopSync Labs · v{version}" — version is
  read from `config.json` at runtime so it always matches the deployed build
- `config.json` is now copied into the Docker image to enable runtime version
  reads

---

## [0.2.5] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- LE cert request now sends `meta: {}` — this NPM version rejects
  `letsencrypt_email` and `letsencrypt_agree` as additional properties; the
  email is taken from the NPM account settings automatically

---

## [0.2.4] - 2026-03-17

### Changed

- **Request SSL is now overwrite-aware** — when a proxy host already exists on
  the target and already has a certificate assigned, the existing cert is
  preserved rather than zeroed out and replaced; a new LE cert is only requested
  if the target host has no certificate at all
- Existing cert on target is also used to restore `ssl_forced` and other SSL
  settings from the source, so re-importing doesn't disturb a working SSL setup
- `existing_ph_by_domain` now stores `(id, certificate_id)` tuples so cert
  status is available without an extra API call

---

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- LE cert request no longer sends `dns_challenge` in the `meta` payload — NPM's
  schema rejects it as an additional property, causing all cert requests to fail
  with a 400 error

---

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- **Request SSL checkbox** — appears next to the Import button; when checked,
  a fresh Let's Encrypt certificate is requested on the target NPM instance for
  every proxy host that had a certificate in the export file but whose cert data
  could not be restored directly (e.g. missing cert files)
- After each LE cert is issued, the proxy host is updated via PUT to apply the
  new certificate ID and restore the original SSL settings (`ssl_forced`,
  `http2_support`, `hsts_enabled`, `hsts_subdomains`) from the export
- The server's configured username (an email) is used as the LE registration
  address automatically — no extra configuration required
- `request_ssl` parameter added to `POST /api/import`; checkbox state persisted
  in `localStorage`

### Changed

- Download and Delete icon buttons moved to the far right of the import actions
  row; Import button and Request SSL checkbox remain on the left

---

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **Download button** — icon button next to Import/Delete; downloads the selected
  export file directly to the browser via `GET /api/files/<filename>`
- `GET /api/files/<filename>` Flask endpoint — serves the export file as an
  attachment download with the same filename validation as the DELETE endpoint

### Changed

- **Delete button** now shows a trash icon (Bootstrap Icons SVG) instead of text;
  the "Confirm?" arming state still shows text, then restores the icon on timeout
  or confirmation
- **Operation status messages** moved from the shared top-of-page status bar into
  inline `<span>` elements next to each section heading — export status appears
  beside "Export", import status beside "Import"; the shared `#op-status-bar` div
  has been removed

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Full web UI via Home Assistant ingress — export and import triggered from the
  add-on panel with live operation status and a scrollable log
- **Multi-server support** — configure any number of NPM instances in the
  Configuration tab; each has a name, URL, username, and password; separate
  Source and Target dropdowns on the Operations tab enable direct
  instance-to-instance migration
- **Interactive 2FA** — when NPM requires a one-time code a modal appears;
  after verification the pending export or import auto-retries automatically
- Dark mode defaulting to system preference, with a toggle saved to
  `localStorage`
- Add-on icon displayed in the page header; `mdi:swap-vertical-bold` sidebar
  icon replaces the default puzzle piece

### Changed

- Export filenames are prefixed with the source server name
  (e.g. `MyNPM-export-20260316T120000Z.json`)
- Import is idempotent — proxy hosts and access lists are updated (PUT) if they
  already exist on the target; streams skip on port conflict rather than
  duplicating
- SSL certificates are exported with their cert and private key and restored as
  custom certificates on the target instance
- All NPM connection settings managed in-UI via the Configuration tab; no
  add-on restart required when changing servers

---

## [0.1.25] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- `panel_icon: mdi:swap-vertical` in `config.json` — sets the sidebar icon
  instead of the default puzzle piece

---

## [0.1.24] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- Operations tab no longer has a large gap between the tab bar and the Export
  card — the status bar collapsed its `min-height` to zero when empty via
  `#op-status-bar:empty`, making the spacing match the Configuration tab

---

## [0.1.23] - 2026-03-15

### Changed

- Export filenames now include the server name as a prefix —
  e.g. `MyNPM-export-20260316T120000Z.json` instead of `npm-export-…json`;
  non-alphanumeric characters in the server name are replaced with underscores

---

## [0.1.22] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- After entering a 2FA code, the pending export or import now actually starts —
  retry `fetch()` calls were fire-and-forget (not awaited); failures were silently
  swallowed. Both retries are now `await`ed with explicit error handling that
  surfaces failures in the status bar.

---

## [0.1.21] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- 2FA Verify button did nothing after a page refresh — `_pendingOp` was null
  (client-side state lost on refresh) causing early bail-out in `submitOtp`
- 2FA modal reappeared on every page refresh because `_pending_2fa` was never
  cleared server-side on cancel; added `POST /api/auth/dismiss2fa` endpoint
- Added Cancel button to the 2FA modal
- `_pending_2fa` now stored as `{challenge_token, server_id}` so the server
  resolves which server to verify against without relying on client state;
  auto-retry still works if `_pendingOp` is available, otherwise shows
  "Authenticated — retry your operation"

---

## [0.1.20] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Restored interactive 2FA support — when NPM requires a one-time code, a modal
  appears asking for the authenticator code; after verification the pending
  export or import auto-retries automatically
- `POST /api/auth/verify2fa` endpoint re-added; `server_id` now passed so the
  session token is cached against the correct server
- `pending_2fa` field added back to `/api/status` response

---

## [0.1.19] - 2026-03-15

### Changed

- NPM servers list and dropdowns now sorted alphabetically by name
- Name input field now styled consistently with other form fields
- Content constrained to 640 px max-width; tab bar centered

---

## [0.1.18] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Multi-server support — configure any number of NPM instances in the Configuration tab,
  each with a name, URL, username, and password
- Separate server dropdowns on Export and Import cards — enables exporting from
  one NPM instance and importing directly into another (migration workflow)
- Server preferences persisted in `localStorage` and restored on next load
- `GET /api/servers`, `POST /api/servers`, `PUT /api/servers/<id>`,
  `DELETE /api/servers/<id>` CRUD endpoints; servers stored in `/data/servers.json`
- Legacy single-server config (`npm_url`/`npm_username`/`npm_password` from
  `options.json`) is automatically migrated to `servers.json` on first boot

### Removed

- `npm_url`, `npm_username`, `npm_password` top-level config options (now managed
  via the Configuration tab servers manager)
- `hassio_api` / `hassio_role` from `config.json` — no longer needed, improves
  security rating

---

## [0.1.17] - 2026-03-15

### Removed

- `npm_token` config option and all associated 2FA infrastructure (interactive OTP
  modal, `POST /api/auth/verify2fa` endpoint, `TwoFactorRequired` exception,
  pending-op auto-retry logic)
- If an NPM account has 2FA enabled the add-on now logs a clear error rather than
  silently prompting — disable 2FA on the NPM account to use this add-on

---

## [0.1.16] - 2026-03-15

### Removed

- Scheduled auto-export feature (`schedule_enabled`, `schedule_interval_hours` config
  options, `_schedule_loop` background thread, Configuration tab schedule card)

---

## [0.1.15] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Add-on icon displayed in the page header alongside the title
- `icon.png` copied into the Docker image and embedded as a base64 data URI
  (no ingress path issues)

---

## [0.1.14] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Dark mode support — defaults to system preference (`prefers-color-scheme`);
  selection saved to `localStorage` and restored on next load
- Theme toggle button (☀️ / 🌙) in the page header
- CSS custom properties for all colors; all UI elements respect the active theme

---

## [0.1.13] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Delete button next to Import Selected — removes the selected export file
  (double-click to confirm, same pattern as Import)
- `DELETE /api/files/<filename>` Flask endpoint

---

## [0.1.12] - 2026-03-15

### Changed

- Import button moved above the file list and now matches the Export button color
- File list is now scrollable with a maximum of 5 visible entries

---

## [0.1.11] - 2026-03-15

### Changed

- Operations tab redesigned for consistency: file list rows are now selectable
  (click to highlight) with a single **Import Selected** button mirroring the
  **Export Now** button — no more per-row import buttons
- Operation status moved to a fixed-height bar above the cards so the page
  layout never shifts when status text appears or disappears
- Removed "Run against a fresh or cleared instance to avoid duplicates" note
  since duplicate handling is now automatic
- Import confirmation uses the single Import Selected button (turn red →
  Confirm? on first click, fires on second click within 3 s)

---

## [0.1.10] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- Proxy host import now PUTs (updates) existing entries instead of skipping on
  "already in use" — ensures `access_list_id` and `certificate_id` remapping is
  always applied even when the host was previously imported
- Proxy host deduplication uses a pre-fetched domain→id map so existing hosts
  are found without relying on error responses

---

## [0.1.9] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- Access list import logs client rule count from the NPM response so silent
  drops are detectable (`(N client rules)` in the log after each create/update)
- Stream import now checks for existing streams by `incoming_port` before
  creating — skips with a warning instead of duplicating

---

## [0.1.8] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- Access list import now PUTs (updates) existing entries instead of skipping
  them — ensures clients and items are always synced even when the access list
  was previously imported without the full data
- Access list import: removed debug payload logging now that 500 errors are resolved

---

## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- Access list import: deduplication GET failure is now a warning rather than
  a hard abort; import continues without duplicate protection
- Access list import: payload is logged before the POST so 500 errors are
  diagnosable; uses `_check()` for consistent error handling and skip-on-conflict

---

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- Access list export now fetches `?expand=items,clients` so auth entries and IP
  rules are included in the backup (previously only the top-level metadata was exported)
- Access list import skips creation if an entry with the same name already exists
  on the target, reusing the existing ID for proxy host remapping instead of
  creating a duplicate
- Stream import payload reduced to the 5 fields the POST endpoint actually accepts
  (`incoming_port`, `forwarding_host`, `forwarding_port`, `tcp_forwarding`,
  `udp_forwarding`) — `enabled` and other fields cause a 400 on this endpoint

---

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- Import 400 errors on access lists, streams — replaced `_strip()` pass-through
  with explicit field allowlists to exclude NPM relation fields (e.g. `proxy_hosts`)
  that GET returns but POST rejects
- Reverted proxy host and redirection host import back to `_strip()` which was
  already working correctly
- Added `_check()` helper to log NPM's error response body on failed imports
  instead of only reporting the HTTP status code
- Configuration tab: after saving, `/data/options.json` is now also written directly
  so `load_options()` returns fresh values without an add-on restart

---

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Configuration tab in the web UI — edit NPM connection details and schedule configuration
  without leaving the HA panel; changes are written back via the HA Supervisor API
  (`POST http://supervisor/addons/self/options`) and reflected in the HA add-on
  Configuration tab immediately
- `GET /api/config` endpoint — returns current add-on options with passwords masked
- `POST /api/config` endpoint — saves updated options via Supervisor API; password
  fields left blank are preserved unchanged (sentinel value pattern)
- `hassio_api: true` and `hassio_role: "default"` in `config.json` to enable
  Supervisor API access

---

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Interactive 2FA popup — when a 2FA-protected NPM account is detected, a modal
  automatically appears asking for the authenticator code; after verification the
  pending operation auto-retries without any further user action
- `npm_token` config option — supply a pre-generated Bearer token to bypass
  interactive auth entirely; required for scheduled exports on 2FA-protected accounts
  since scheduled runs are unattended and cannot prompt for an OTP
- Server-side JWT session cache — a successful login (interactive or password-based)
  is cached for the token's lifetime (~24h) so repeated operations do not re-authenticate
- `POST /api/auth/verify2fa` Flask endpoint — receives the challenge token and OTP
  code, completes the NPM 2FA flow, and caches the resulting JWT

---

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- Added `bash` to the Dockerfile via `apk add --no-cache bash` — `python:3.11-alpine`
  ships with `ash` only; HA Supervisor invokes `run.sh` with bash, causing a startup crash
- Set `SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]` so subsequent `RUN` steps use bash

---

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Flask web server with HA ingress UI — export and import are now triggered
  via buttons in the add-on panel rather than config-driven one-shot runs
- **Export Now** button writes a timestamped JSON backup to
  `/share/npm-export-import/`
- **Import** button per backup file — restores entries into NPM in
  dependency order (certs → access lists → proxy hosts → redirections → streams)
- Live log panel in the UI, polling every 2 seconds
- `schedule_enabled` / `schedule_interval_hours` config options for
  automatic background exports while the web UI stays available
- SSL certificate export: Let's Encrypt cert files (fullchain + private key)
  read directly from the shared `/ssl/nginxproxymanager/live/npm-{id}/` volume
  and stored base64-encoded in the export bundle
- SSL certificate import: certs re-uploaded to target NPM instance via the
  certificate upload API; old-to-new ID remapping applied to all referencing hosts
- Access list import with old-to-new ID remapping for proxy host references
- Mutex-guarded background thread runner — only one operation runs at a time
- `ingress: true` and `ingress_port: 8099` in `config.json`
- `map: ["share:rw", "ssl:rw"]` for export file storage and cert file access

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Initial scaffold for the NPM Export Import add-on

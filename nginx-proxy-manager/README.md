# Nginx Proxy Manager Host

![Version][version-shield]
![Project Stage][project-stage-shield]
![Maintained][maintenance-shield]

Expose your services easily and securely with a beautiful web GUI for Nginx.
This app runs the **latest upstream** ([ZoeyVid/NPMplus](https://github.com/ZoeyVid/NPMplus)) image (currently v2026-07-24-r1).

## Features

- Free SSL via Let's Encrypt (HTTP-01 and DNS-01 challenges)
- Reverse proxy with custom locations, websocket support, and access lists
- Redirect and 404 hosts
- Beautiful web UI on port 81
- Streams support

## Ports

| Port | Protocol  | Description                        |
| ---- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 80   | TCP       | HTTP proxy traffic                 |
| 81   | TCP       | Admin web UI                       |
| 443  | TCP / UDP | HTTPS proxy traffic (QUIC Support) |
| Any  | TCP / UDP | Any port you'd like                |

## Initial access

After the app starts, open the admin UI at `http://<your-ha-ip>:81` and follow
the onboarding/login flow shown by the current upstream Nginx Proxy Manager
release.

## Data persistence

NPM's database and configuration are stored in the app's `/data` directory and
persist across restarts and updates.

## Upgrading

Update the app through the Home Assistant UI when a new version is published.

Your Nginx Proxy Manager data, configuration, and certificates are stored under
`/data`, so they persist across normal app upgrades and restarts.

After upgrading, verify that:

1. The app starts successfully.
2. The admin UI is reachable on port 81.
3. Existing proxy hosts, certificates, and settings are still present.

## Notes

- Ports 80 and 443 must be free on the host — disable HA's built-in nginx if it occupies them.
- This add-on does **not** use a HA base image; it uses the official NPMPlus Docker image directly.
- This fork adds Stream support by the use of network host mode
- This fork replaces NPM with NPMPlus for extra features and QUIC support (HTTPS/3)
